# Empty State

EmptyState shows a placeholder when a content area has no data. Use it for empty lists, zero search results, first-time setups, or cleared inboxes. Always include a title and a next step so the user is not stuck.

**Import:** `import {EmptyState} from '@astryxdesign/core/EmptyState';`

## Anatomy

| Element | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Icon | No | A visual cue above the title that reinforces the context, like a search icon for no results. |
| Title | Yes | Primary message explaining what is empty: "No projects yet" not "No data". |
| Description | No | Additional context explaining why it is empty or what the user can do. |
| Actions | No | One or two buttons guiding the user to a next step, like "Create project" or "Clear filters". |

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `string` | — | Primary message rendered as an <h3> heading inside the empty state. |
| `description` | `string` | — | Optional secondary text providing additional context below the title. |
| `icon` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional icon or illustration displayed above the title; rendered as decorative (aria-hidden="true"). |
| `actions` | `ReactNode` | — | Optional action buttons displayed below the description, laid out horizontally by default and stacked vertically when isCompact is true. |
| `headingLevel` | `1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6` | `3` | Controls only the rendered HTML heading tag (h1-h6) so the title fits the document outline. This is a semantic change for accessibility and does not change the visual size of the title, which stays fixed regardless of level. |
| `isCompact` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables the compact variant with reduced spacing for constrained content areas. |
| `xstyle` | `StyleXStyles` | — | StyleX styles for layout customization (margins, positioning, sizing). Must be a stylex.create() value, not an inline style object like style={{}}. |

## Best practices

- **Do:** Include a clear title and a call-to-action button so users know how to proceed.
- **Do:** Use an illustration or icon that reinforces the context of the empty state.
- **Do:** Use the compact variant inside cards or sidebars where space is limited.
- **Don't:** Leave an empty state without guidance; always explain what happened and what the user can do next.
- **Don't:** Use a generic message like "No data"; be specific about what is empty and why.
- **Don't:** Use an EmptyState for error messages that require immediate action; use a Banner instead.

## Canonical defaults

```json
{
  "title": "No results found",
  "description": "Try adjusting your search or filter criteria.",
  "actions": {
    "__element": "Button",
    "props": {
      "label": "Clear filters",
      "variant": "secondary"
    }
  }
}
```
