# File Input

FileInput provides file upload with optional drag-and-drop support. Use it for single or multiple file selection with built-in validation for file type, size, and count. Pair with validation status for upload feedback.

**Import:** `import {FileInput} from '@astryxdesign/core/FileInput';`

## Anatomy

| Element | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Label | Yes | Text that identifies the field. Always rendered for accessibility even when visually hidden. |
| Description | No | Helper text between the label and the drop zone explaining accepted formats or size limits. |
| Drop zone | Yes | The clickable area for file selection. In dropzone mode, also accepts dragged files. |
| Upload icon | No | An arrow icon in the drop zone hinting at the upload action. |
| Placeholder | No | Hint text shown when no files are selected. |
| File name display | No | Shows the name(s) of selected files. |
| Clear button | No | A close button that removes selected files and returns focus to the input. |
| Spinner | No | Loading indicator that appears during async upload actions. |
| Status message | No | Validation feedback showing error, warning, or success with a message. |

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | `string` | — | Accessible label for the file input. |
| `value` | `File | File[] | null` | — | Currently selected file(s). Controlled component. |
| `onChange` | `(files: File | File[] | null) => void` | — | Callback fired when files are selected or removed. |
| `changeAction` | `(files: File | File[] | null) => Promise<void>` | — | Async change action (React 19 transitions pattern). Use for immediate upload on file selection. |
| `accept` | `string` | — | Accepted file types. Uses the HTML accept attribute format (e.g. "image/*", ".pdf,.doc"). |
| `isMultiple` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether multiple files can be selected. When true, value and onChange use File[] instead of File. |
| `maxSize` | `number` | — | Maximum file size in bytes. Files exceeding this are rejected with an error status. |
| `maxFiles` | `number` | — | Maximum number of files (only applies when isMultiple is true). |
| `isLabelHidden` | `boolean` | `false` | Visually hides the label while keeping it accessible to screen readers. |
| `description` | `string` | — | Description text displayed between the label and input. |
| `isOptional` | `boolean` | `false` | Displays an "Optional" indicator next to the label. Mutually exclusive with isRequired. |
| `isRequired` | `boolean` | `false` | Displays a "Required" indicator next to the label and adds a screen-reader-only "Required" description to the trigger (assistive tech does not reliably announce aria-required on the trigger). Mutually exclusive with isOptional. |
| `isDisabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables the input, preventing interaction and dimming the element. |
| `disabledMessage` | `string` | — | Explains why the input is disabled. With isDisabled, shows a tooltip on hover/keyboard focus and keeps the trigger focusable via aria-disabled (opening the file picker stays blocked). Use this instead of wrapping a disabled FileInput in Tooltip; disabled controls swallow the hover events an external Tooltip needs. |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | `false` | Puts the input in a loading state, showing a spinner and setting aria-busy. |
| `placeholder` | `string` | `"Choose file" or "Choose files"` | Placeholder text shown when no file is selected. |
| `mode` | `'input' | 'dropzone'` | `'input'` | Visual mode. 'input' is a compact inline style; 'dropzone' is a larger area with drag-and-drop support. |
| `status` | `{type: 'error' | 'warning' | 'success', message?: string}` | — | Validation status: applies a colored border. If message is provided, displays a floating message below the input. Error type also sets aria-invalid. |
| `statusVariant` | `'attached' | 'detached' | 'tooltip'` | `'attached'` | How the status message is placed relative to the input. attached overlaps directly below the input (bordered treatment); detached floats below as a separate element with spacing; tooltip hides the message box and surfaces it in a tooltip on the status icon. |
| `labelTooltip` | `string` | — | Tooltip text displayed in an info icon at the end of the label. |
| `width` | `SizeValue` | — | Width of the field (number = pixels, string used as-is, e.g. "100%"). Sizes the whole field (label, control, and status) so they stay aligned. |

## Best practices

- **Do:** Always specify an accept prop to guide users toward valid file types.
- **Do:** Use maxSize and maxFiles to prevent oversized uploads; the component handles validation and error display automatically.
- **Do:** Add a description to communicate constraints like file size limits or accepted formats.
- **Do:** Use changeAction for immediate upload workflows that benefit from optimistic UI.
- **Don't:** Don't use FileInput for directory or folder uploads; that is not supported in v1.
- **Don't:** Don't avoid dropzone mode unless space is constrained; drag-and-drop is the expected interaction for file uploads.
- **Don't:** Don't wrap a disabled FileInput in Tooltip to explain why it's disabled; disabled controls swallow the hover events the wrapper needs. Use the disabledMessage prop instead.

## Theming
