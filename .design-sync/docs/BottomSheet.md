# Bottom Sheet

A mobile touch surface for filters, actions, forms, and detail views that should rise from the bottom of the viewport; use BottomSheetSwitcher for multi-step flows.

**Import:** `import {BottomSheet} from '@astryxdesign/core/BottomSheet';`

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `isOpen` | `boolean` | — | Whether a standalone sheet is open. Fully controlled; pair with onOpenChange. Omit inside BottomSheetSwitcher. |
| `onOpenChange` | `(isOpen: boolean) => void` | — | For a standalone sheet, called when it requests an open-state change. Automatic calls follow purpose: info dismisses on Escape, scrim click, or swipe; form dismisses on Escape only; required never dismisses implicitly. Omit inside BottomSheetSwitcher. |
| `purpose` | `'required' | 'form' | 'info'` | `'info'` | Controls implicit dismissal behavior, matching Dialog. info allows Escape, scrim click, and swipe-to-dismiss. form protects entered data by blocking scrim click and swipe while allowing Escape. required blocks every implicit dismissal path and uses role='alertdialog'. Explicit controls may still update the controlled state. Works for standalone and BottomSheetSwitcher-managed sheets. |
| `sheetId` | `string` | — | Unique ID for this sheet inside BottomSheetSwitcher. The switcher opens it when activeSheet matches. Omit isOpen and onOpenChange when sheetId is used. |
| `label` | `string` | — | Accessible label for the sheet. Required; the sheet has no built-in heading to derive a name from. |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | — | Sheet content, rendered below the grab handle in a scrollable area. If it includes a text-entry control that can bring up the mobile keyboard, use height='tall' and keep the sheet fully expanded while editing. |
| `height` | `'hug' | 'capped' | 'tall' | number | string` | `'capped'` | How tall the sheet is. Named budgets: 'hug' fits its content up to 92% of the viewport, 'capped' is a scrolling mid-height panel (~62%), and 'tall' is a pinned near-full panel (~92%) for content that streams in. Or pass a number (px) / CSS length for a custom budget. Give snapPoints to let the user drag between heights. On shorter viewports the sheet fills the available height. Only a fully expanded 'tall' sheet provides mobile-keyboard accommodation: it stays put and scrolls each focused control above the keyboard. Hug, Capped, numeric and CSS-length heights never do, and a Tall sheet stops doing it the moment the user drags it to a shorter detent, resuming when they drag it back. Outside that state the sheet neither moves nor adds keyboard scroll space, and the browser's own focus reveal is left in place; on iOS that reveal can shift the whole page. |
| `snapPoints` | `ReadonlyArray<number | string>` | — | Extra heights the sheet can rest at when dragged; its own height is always the tallest stop, and omitting this gives a sheet that only opens and closes. Each stop is the sheet's visible height: a number is a viewport fraction (0.5 is half the screen), '50%' the same in CSS, '320px' an absolute length. A stop of a quarter of the sheet or less is a peek: it slides away instead of reflowing, and thins the scrim. |
| `hasScrim` | `boolean` | `true` | For a standalone BottomSheet, whether to render a scrim, the semi-transparent overlay that covers and blocks the background. true (default) uses showModal(): top layer, focus trap, ::backdrop scrim, body scroll lock, and tap-scrim-to-dismiss when purpose='info', with the background inert. false uses show() with no scrim, leaving the page behind interactive and scrollable. For a multi-step flow, configure hasScrim on BottomSheetSwitcher instead; it owns one shared dialog across every child. |

## Best practices

- **Do:** Use for mobile-first surfaces (filters, share sheets, quick actions) where the content should rise from the bottom edge.
- **Do:** Pick the starting height that fits the content: 'hug' for short bounded content, 'capped' for lists, and 'tall' for forms or streaming/resizing content.
- **Do:** Use purpose='form' to protect entered data from scrim clicks and swipes while keeping Escape available; reserve purpose='required' for flows that must end through an explicit action.
- **Don't:** Don't make the sheet content overly long. Consider breaking it into steps and using Bottom Sheet Switcher.

        {
          "__element": "Heading",
          "props": {
            "level": 3
          },
          "children": "Filters"
        },
        {
          "__element": "Text",
          "props": {
            "type": "body"
          },
          "children": "Adjust the properties below, then open the preview."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
