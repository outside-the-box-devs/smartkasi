# Timestamp

Timestamp formats a date or time value into human-readable text. Use it to show when something was created, updated, or is scheduled; picking relative for recency, absolute for precision, or auto to let the component decide.

**Import:** `import {Timestamp} from '@astryxdesign/core/Timestamp';`

## Anatomy

| Element | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Formatted text | Yes | The rendered date, time, or relative label like "2 hours ago" or "Mar 21, 2025". |
| Hover card | No | A copyable hover card showing the full absolute date and time when the display is relative, or the rows configured via tooltipEntries. Its default single row carries the full absolute time. |
| Hover card row | No | One row of the card: an optional label beside the instant rendered in one time zone and format. Rows opt into a copy button via isCopyable. |
| Copy button | Yes | Per-row copy-to-clipboard button in the hover card; copies that row's formatted value. |

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | `string | number` | — | The date/time to display. Accepts Unix timestamps (seconds) or ISO 8601 strings. |
| `format` | `'relative' | 'relative_short' | 'auto' | 'date' | 'date_long' | 'date_weekday' | 'date_time' | 'time' | 'system_date' | 'system_date_time' | 'system_time' | 'unix_seconds'` | `'auto'` | Display format. 'relative' shows '2 hours ago', 'relative_short' shows the same tiers abbreviated ('2h ago', '1d ago', '3mo ago') for compact surfaces, 'date' shows 'Mar 21, 2025', 'date_long' shows 'March 21, 2025', 'date_weekday' shows 'Wed, Mar 21, 2025', 'date_time' shows 'Mar 21, 2025, 2:51 PM', 'time' shows '2:51 PM', 'system_*' variants use ISO-style formatting, 'unix_seconds' shows the Unix time in whole seconds since the epoch (an absolute, zone-independent value), 'auto' switches from relative to date_time based on recency. |
| `autoThreshold` | `number` | `604800` | Threshold in seconds for 'auto' format to switch from relative to date_time. |
| `hasTooltip` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to show a copyable hover card with the full date/time on hover. Applies to relative timestamps and to any format once tooltipEntries is configured. |
| `tooltipEntries` | `ReadonlyArray<{timezoneID?: string; format?: TimestampTooltipFormat; label?: string; isCopyable?: boolean}>` | — | Lines to show on hover, so one instant can be read (and optionally copied) in several time zones and/or formats at once. Each entry is one line, in the order given. Omit timezoneID (or pass 'local') for the viewer's own zone; format defaults to the full absolute style and also accepts 'full' alongside every non-relative TimestampFormat. Rows are read-only unless they set isCopyable (default false); copyable rows show a copy button in a dedicated trailing action column so buttons align, and the column is only present when some row is copyable. With no entries the card shows a single default row with the full absolute time, which is copyable. Configuring entries also attaches the surface to absolute formats, which otherwise have none. |
| `isTimezoneShown` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to append the timezone abbreviation to the visible text. Applies to the date_time and time formats; system_* formats stay machine-readable and never carry one. Use tooltipEntries to control the tooltip's time zones. |
| `isLive` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the relative time should update live (e.g. "2 min ago" → "3 min ago"). |
| `type` | `'body' | 'large' | 'label' | 'supporting' | 'code' | 'display-1' | 'display-2' | 'display-3' | 'inherit'` | `'supporting'` | Semantic text type from Text. Determines size, weight, and line-height. |
| `size` | `'4xs' | '3xs' | '2xs' | 'xsm' | 'sm' | 'base' | 'lg' | 'xl' | '2xl' | '3xl' | '4xl'` | — | Explicit font size override. Overrides the size from type. |
| `color` | `'primary' | 'secondary' | 'disabled' | 'placeholder' | 'accent' | 'inherit'` | `'secondary'` | Text color. |
| `weight` | `'normal' | 'medium' | 'semibold' | 'bold'` | — | Font weight override. |

## Best practices

- **Do:** Use the auto format in feeds and lists so recent items show "2 hours ago" and older items show the full date automatically.
- **Do:** Keep formatting consistent within the same list or table; mixing relative and absolute timestamps in the same column confuses scanning.
- **Do:** Enable isTimezoneShown when the audience spans multiple time zones, like a global team calendar or audit log.
- **Do:** Use tooltipEntries when readers must compare zones, such as an incident log where the reader's time and the event's origin zone both matter.
- **Do:** Label every entry once a tooltip shows more than one zone; a bare abbreviation is not always recognizable (Tokyo renders as "GMT+9", not "JST").
- **Do:** Use isLive for active dashboards or real-time feeds so the relative time stays accurate without a page refresh.
- **Do:** Reach for tooltipEntries when readers need to grab an exact value: an incident log or deploy record where someone pastes the UTC time or Unix seconds elsewhere; configuring entries turns the hover into copy-to-clipboard rows.
- **Don't:** Don't display raw Unix timestamps or ISO strings to users; always pass them through Timestamp to get a human-readable format.
- **Don't:** Avoid system_date or system_time formats in user-facing UI; they are meant for developer tools, logs, and machine-readable contexts.
- **Don't:** Don't disable the hover card on relative timestamps; users expect to hover for the full date when they see "3 hours ago".
- **Don't:** Don't stack many zones into one card; it is capped at 300px wide and long labelled lines wrap. Two or three entries read well.
- **Don't:** Don't pass a fixed-offset abbreviation like "EST" as timezoneID; it is a valid identifier but never observes daylight saving, so it reads an hour wrong for half the year. Use the region id, "America/New_York".

## Canonical defaults

```json
{
  "value": "2026-02-19T17:00:00Z"
}
```

## Theming

- `astryx-timestamp` — varies by: type, color, format
- `astryx-timestamp-copy-button`
